<p class="message">
  I'm a veteran game developer of over 20 years. I've been working almost exclusively with Unity for the past decade. I'm an avid experimenter with a desire to make life easier for the artists and designers around me. I need a place to store half-formed ideas, considerations on architecture and methodologies, and other thoughts. This is that place.

I'm currently the Lead Programmer at an internal studio of Nexon, working on an unannounced title.
